# Development Conventions

Unified, action-oriented conventions for source editing, review, and tests. Detailed rules live in the matching references below.

## 🔴 Mandatory Reference Gate

Before acting, read [`references/useful-comments/guidelines.md`](references/useful-comments/guidelines.md) for **every source edit or source review**. For **every behavioral source change, test edit, test review, or test execution**, also read [`references/testing/patterns.md`](references/testing/patterns.md); Python work additionally requires the matching Python test references. For domain work, read only the matching references below. Do not act until all mandatory and matching references are read. Repository-specific safety and test instructions override generic examples. Avoid loading unrelated references.

## When to Use

- README or documentation work: read the README or documentation-writing reference; include API documentation references when documenting an API.
- API work: designing, implementing, reviewing, or testing HTTP routes, handlers, controllers, status codes, error responses, auth, pagination, rate limits, idempotency, or aggregation.
- Next.js 16 App Router work: any `app/` route, Server Component, Client Component, fetch/cache policy, build configuration, route/navigation behavior, Server Action/form/mutation, streaming/loading/error state, metadata/SEO, or cross-file hygiene review; read only the relevant category references when a project actually uses Next.js.
- Python work: any `*.py` edit, review, build, lint, type-check, or test; read build/test, typing/docs, testing/tools, and style/security references as applicable, plus the mandatory testing reference for behavioral changes and test work.
- Go or Rust work: any Go or Rust source, test, review, formatting, lint, or build; read the language-conventions source index.
- Regex work: creating, reviewing, escaping, or optimizing a regular expression; read the regex reference.
- Mermaid work: creating or reviewing a Mermaid diagram; read the Mermaid reference.
- Gitignore work: editing or reviewing `.gitignore` patterns; read the gitignore reference.
- Testing work: writing, changing, reviewing, or running unit, integration, E2E, Playwright, or pytest tests; read the testing reference and any matching domain reference.
- Web/UI work: reviewing or changing layout, responsive behavior, accessibility, visual consistency, overlays, cards, or browser-facing behavior; read the web-design and matching visual/UI references.
- Message-like UI work: changing a message list, sync status, cache, settings, or assistant response behavior; read the message UI source index and only its matching linked references.
- Open Rig v2 work: changing MCP/plugin/configuration layering, deployment, skill bundles, commands, scripts, or bounded verification; read the Open Rig operations references and the repository-root `AGENTS.md`.

|------|-------------|

| [`references/nextjs-conventions/cache-use-cache-directive.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/cache-use-cache-directive.md) | Every Server Action that mutates data must invalidate the routes/tags that surface it — the failure mode is silent staleness |

| [`references/nextjs-conventions/cross-boundary-coherence.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/cross-boundary-coherence.md) | SSR and client initial render must produce identical HTML — defer browser-only or time-varying values to a post-mount effect |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/cross-component-consolidation.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/cross-component-consolidation.md) | Wrap third-party scripts in `next/script` with the right `strategy` — never `<script src=...>` in the layout `<head>` |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/cross-dead-code.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/cross-dead-code.md) | Push the `'use client'` directive down to the interactive leaf — not up at the route/layout |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/cross-extract-shared-logic.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/cross-extract-shared-logic.md) | Audit `'use client'` placement across the route tree — demote files (or whole subtrees) that don't need the client |

| [`references/nextjs-conventions/route-intercepting-routes.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/route-intercepting-routes.md) | Generate per-page OG images at the route via `opengraph-image.tsx` — not a static fallback in `public/` |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/route-not-found.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/route-not-found.md) | Make crawl rules explicit via `app/robots.ts` and per-page `metadata.robots` — don't rely on "they won't crawl this" |

| [`references/nextjs-conventions/route-prefetching.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/route-prefetching.md) | Modal/lightbox detail views with shareable URLs should use intercepting routes — not client-state modals |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/route-proxy-ts.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/route-proxy-ts.md) | A missing dynamic resource calls `notFound()` to produce a real HTTP 404 — never returns "not found" inline JSX with a 200 status |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/server-avoid-client-fetching.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/server-avoid-client-fetching.md) | Multi-region layouts that show independent content per region should use parallel-route slots, not one mega `page.tsx` |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/server-component-streaming.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/server-component-streaming.md) | Tune `<Link prefetch>` to traffic likelihood — disable on low-traffic links, prefetch-on-hover for conditional routes |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/server-data-colocation.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/server-data-colocation.md) | Network-boundary logic (auth, redirects, header rewrites) lives in `proxy.ts` — not the deprecated `middleware.ts` |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/server-error-handling.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/server-error-handling.md) | Initial page data lands in the HTML via a Server Component — never via `useEffect`+`fetch` or client-side data libraries |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/server-parallel-fetching.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/server-parallel-fetching.md) | Wrap each independently-paced async leaf in its own `<Suspense>` so fast content streams without waiting for slow tiles |

| [`references/nextjs-conventions/stream-error-tsx.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/stream-error-tsx.md) | Contain each async failure to its own subtree via `error.tsx` or `ErrorBoundary` — one bad fetch must not take down the route |

| [`references/nextjs-conventions/action-pending-states.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/action-pending-states.md) | Next.js review categories and impact levels: build, cache, server, route, action, stream, metadata, client, and cross-file hygiene |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/action-revalidation.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/action-revalidation.md) | Server Actions return a typed error/state result — never throw silently or rely on the client to know what failed |
| [`references/nextjs-conventions/action-server-action-forms.md`](references/nextjs-conventions/action-server-action-forms.md) | Mutations whose UI outcome is predictable apply optimistically with `useOptimistic` — automatic rollback on server failure |

## Open Rig operating boundary

- Read the repository-root `AGENTS.md` before acting. It is the authority for
  OpenCode v2, canonical paths, safety, and verification.
- Canonical source lives under
  `platforms/linux/ubuntu/computer-use/`; do not edit generated user config or
  deployed skill copies directly.
- Verification is read-only by default. Any setup or deployment write requires
  an explicit `--apply` and an explicitly selected target.
- Deploy skill bundles only through
  `platforms/linux/ubuntu/computer-use/scripts/setup-opencode.sh`; it copies the
  complete canonical bundle and preserves unrelated target files.
- Preserve unrelated files. Refuse symlinked paths, symlink ancestors, and
  source entries that are not regular files during deployment.
- Run expensive checks through
  `platforms/linux/ubuntu/computer-use/scripts/run-bounded-command.sh`.
